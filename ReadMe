Use ss_move_entity_init() in each player/entity's create event and pass in as many object as you want.

ss_move_entity_init(obj_solid, obj_player_barrier, obj_concrete);

If you want an object to collide with only a certain type of wall, maybe the enemies should be
able to pass through obj_player_barrier, you can do:

ss_move_entity(obj_solid, obj_concrete);

This entity won't collide with player barriers, allowing for more flexible level design.

You'll need to replace xvel and yvel with whatever movement variables you are using,
like hspeed or vspeed.

///@arg obj*

/*
Example
In the player create event:

ss_move_entity_init(obj_solid, obj_player_barrier);

The player will now collide with obj_solid and obj_player_barrier.
If you want the player to only collide with obj_solid, you can do:

ss_move_entity_init(obj_solid);

You can add as many objects as you want, unless GameMaker has an argument limit
That I am unaware of. This allows players to be restricted to a certain area while
enemies can still pass through, which can be useful in a wave based game for example.
Maybe ghost enemies can pass through wood blocks and closed wooden doors but not walls.
It's a lot more flexible.

Noone as the only argument will work as well if you need an object to collide with
nothing at all.
